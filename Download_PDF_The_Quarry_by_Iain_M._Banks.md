Eighteen-year-old Kit is weird: big, strange, odd, socially disabled, on a spectrum that stretches from &amp;quot;highly gifted&amp;quot; at one end, to &amp;quot;nutter&amp;quot; at the other. At least Kit knows who his father is; he and Guy live together in a decaying country house on the unstable brink of a vast quarry. His mother&amp;#039;s identity is another matter. Now, though, his father&amp;#039;s dying, and old friends are gathering for one last time.
 
 &amp;quot;Uncle&amp;quot; Paul&amp;#039;s a media lawyer now; Rob and Ali are upwardly mobile corporate bunnies; pretty, hopeful Pris is a single mother; Haze is still living up to his drug-inspired name twenty years on; and fierce, protective Hol is a gifted if acerbic critic. As young film students they lived at Willoughtree House with Guy, and they&amp;#039;ve all come back because they want something. Kit, too, has his own ulterior motives. Before his father dies he wants to know who his mother is, and what&amp;#039;s on the mysterious tape they&amp;#039;re all looking for. But most of all he wants to stop time and keep his father alive.
 
 Fast-paced, gripping and savagely funny, The Quarry is a virtuoso performance whose soaring riffs on the inexhaustible marvel of human perception and rage against the dying of the light will stand among Iain Banks&amp;#039; greatest work.
