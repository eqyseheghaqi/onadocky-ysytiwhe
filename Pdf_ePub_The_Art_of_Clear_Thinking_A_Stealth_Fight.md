Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller We are stoked for this guide to decision making from real-life Top Gun fighter pilot Hasard Lee. Someone who can think clearly while traveling twice the speed of sound can certainly help the rest of us learn how to make the right choices in much less fraught circumstances. Based on a career of making high-stakes, split-second decisions as a U.S. fighter pilot, The Art of Clear Thinking teaches readers to apply Hasard Lee&#039;s combat-tested techniques in everyday life.

 The training to become a fighter pilot is among the most competitive and difficult in the world with fewer than one in a thousand succeeding. Pushing a cutting-edge jet to its limits at over 1,000 mph means that every split-second decision can have catastrophic consequences. This extreme environment has forged a group of warriors who for the last fifty years have been considered at the apex of decision-making theory and practice.

 In The Art of Clear Thinking, Hasard Lee distills what heâ€™s learned during his career flying some of the Air Forceâ€™s most advanced aircraft. With gripping firsthand accounts from his time as a fighter pilot and fascinating turning points throughout history, Hasard reveals powerful decision-making principles that can be used in business and in life, including:

 â€¢ HOW TO LEARN BETTER AND FASTER
 â€¢ CULTIVATING MENTAL TOUGHNESS
 â€¢ DEVELOPING THE SKILLS TO QUICKLY ASSESS, CHOOSE, AND EXECUTE
 â€¢ AND MUCH, MUCH MORE

 Hasard has used and taught these techniques across the full spectrum of human endeavors and proven their effectiveness in both the cockpit and the boardroom. Those who have already benefited include CEOâ€™s, astronauts, CIA agents, students, parents, and many others. The Art of Clear Thinking is a book that will change how you interact with the world around you.
