 THE GOLDEN HUSTLA
 
 She&#039;s the star sales associate of a profitable Atlanta &quot;advertising&quot; firm, WMM. She lives for top-of-the-line everything . . . and making enough money to finally reunite with her children. But Nina Coles is an ex-hood-rat in hiding. And no amount of paper can keep her safe from a ruthless FBI agent who&#039;s determined to take down the shady company she works for. Now Nina&#039;s vicious, greedy boss Rinaldo is defying the feds and endangering everyone to rack up several last scores. Her conniving ex-partner Akil is playing Nina against WMM and the mob to get his hands on the company&#039;s multimillion-dollar stash. And sexy undercover cop Rick is proving to be one danger Nina can&#039;t figure out-or get enough of. Between betrayal, lies, and murder, Nina must risk everything on one last deadly hustle that almost guarantees winner lose all . . .
