Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Did someone say seven steamy billionaires? Based on the seven deadly sins? Do you know what else goes with the &quot;seventh&quot;? Heaven. *A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER* An arranged marriage billionaire romance standalone from New York Times bestselling author and BookTok sensation Ana Huang. She was my North Star, the brightest jewel in my sky. Ruthless. Meticulous. Arrogant. Billionaire CEO Dante Russo thrives on control, both personally and professionally. He never planned to marryâ€¦until the threat of blackmail forces him into an engagement with a woman he barely knows. Vivian Lau, jewelry heiress and daughter of his newest enemy. The wife he never wanted, and the weakness he never saw coming. It doesn&#039;t matter how beautiful or charming she is. Dante will do everything in his power to destroy the blackmail and their betrothal. There&#039;s only one problem: now that he has her, he can&#039;t bring himself to let her go. *** Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered. Vivian Lau is the perfect daughter and her family&#039;s ticket into the highest echelons of society. Marrying a blue-blooded Russo means opening doors that would otherwise remain closed to her new-money parents. While the rude, elusive Dante isn&#039;t her idea of a dream partner, she agrees to their arranged marriage out of duty. Craving his touch was never part of the plan. Neither was the worst possible outcome: falling in love with her future husband.
