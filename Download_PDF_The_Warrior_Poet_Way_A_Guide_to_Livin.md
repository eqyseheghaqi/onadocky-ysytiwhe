From the founder of the Warrior Poet Society, a daring manual on how to become a dangerousâ€”and goodâ€”man

 There is a war on masculinity, and everywhere we lookâ€”on every front we hold sacredâ€”we can see the painful reminders of this collapsing order. The chaos and crisis we are experiencing today should be a signal for men everywhere to rise up; to fight to preserve our way of life by once again walking the ancient paths. But this isnâ€™t a journey that need be taken alone.

 In The Warrior Poet Way, public speaker, former Army Ranger, and all-around patriot John Lovell offers a needed antidote to the lack of strong men in our modern world. This is a call to all men to be what they truly are. Both dangerous and good. Lovers and fighters. Lions and lambs.

 Both philosophical and practical, this guide dispenses essential advice on how to be a whole man, from tyranny-proofing your home to wooing the right woman. Through anecdotes of his time in the military, interviews with other men, and practicums at the end of each chapter, Lovell teaches the virtue of balanceâ€”navigating the tension between violent warrior and romantic poetâ€”and guides men through each mental and physical change they must make to embody the ancient spirit of a real man.

 This is a manual for every man to use in the fight of their lifeâ€”and what it takes to win. No good thing comes easy, and the life you want is just on the other end of what you donâ€™t want to do. This is the Warrior Poet Way. Are you ready to walk it?
