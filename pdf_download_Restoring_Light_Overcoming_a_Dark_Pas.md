Overview
In &quot;Restoring Light: Overcoming a Dark Past,&quot; JT Dixon delivers a powerful and poignant narrative that traces the harrowing journey of African slaves from the lush lands of their homeland to the oppressive plantations of America. Through the eyes of Ezekiel, an ancestor determined to share his family&#039;s story, readers are drawn into a world of unimaginable suffering and unyielding resilience.
 This compelling work illuminates the brutal realities of slavery, from the violent separations of families and the psychological torture inflicted upon the enslaved, to the horrific sexual exploitation faced by women like Sarah. Dixon&#039;s narrative does not shy away from the darkness but instead offers a beacon of hope, emphasizing the enduring strength of the human spirit.
 &quot;Restoring Light&quot; is not just a recounting of history; it is a call to acknowledge the deep scars left by slavery and the generational trauma it has caused. Through the powerful legacy of Ezekiel and his family, Dixon inspires a journey of healing and empowerment, urging readers to confront and understand the past to build a future of justice and unity.
